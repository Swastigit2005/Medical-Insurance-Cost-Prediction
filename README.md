# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Medical insurance costs vary significantly based on multiple factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of dependents, and region. Accurately predicting these costs is crucial for insurance providers, healthcare organizations, and individuals to make informed financial and healthcare decisions.

This project aims to develop a Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Model using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The model will analyze historical insurance data and learn patterns to estimate the expected insurance costs for an individual based on key demographic and lifestyle attributes.

Objectives:
Predict insurance charges based on user inputs such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other medical/lifestyle factors.
Analyze the impact of different variables on medical insurance costs.
Help insurance companies assess risk and optimize premium pricing.
Assist individuals in estimating their expected insurance costs and making informed healthcare choices.
